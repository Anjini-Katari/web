    <h2> What is music? </h2> <br>
        <p> Ahhhh music. Sometimes its the only way I can survive the upcoming week of assignments, 
            tests, quizzes and zoom meetings. We hear it on the radio, the streetin nature - you 
            can find music anywhere you go. But what it is? 
        </p> <br>
        <p> The ever reliable <a href=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/music?s=t> dictionary</a>  <!-- format for link: <a href=ENTERLINKHERE=t> dictionary</a> | <a> is the code for link--> 
            defines music as "an art of sound in time that expresses
            ideas and emotions in significant forms through the elements of rhythm, melody, harmony,
            and color." If that mde sense to you, I applaud you. If it didn't, same here (though I 
            could just be tired). So if we're not using the Dictionary's definition, how should we
            define music? 
        </p> <br> 
        <p> In my mind, I define music as something that makes me feel something. Its the invocation of
        emotions from when I hear the right chord, or harmonies, or melodies. Music is thing you can
        turn to when you're not sure how you're feeling. You just feel so bad or good or meh just like a
        vibe. Music can help you be in touch with that. Music is a special kind of magic that makes
        everything a little better.

    <h2> The best- I mean my favorite genres </h2> <br>
    
    <h3> Rock </h3>
        <p> Unpopular fact: I don't listen to The Beatles. I mean sure I've some of there songs, but honestly?
            Not really my jam. Grunge rock on the other hand is my jam! I also love alt rock, metal, punk/emo and 
            a few other subgenres I sadly don't know the names of. Some my favorite artists from this genre are:
            Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Soundgarden, grandson, Radiohead, System of a Down, Green Day, Panic! At the Disco, 
            and Matt Maeson (just to name a few...) 
        </p> <br> 
        <p id="music"> <a href=https://youtu.be/YJft6_5hlGo=t> Serve the Servants, Nirvana</a> </p> <br> <!-- Nirvana --> 
    <h3> Electronic </h3>
        <p> The electronic genre is so much bigger than we give it credit for. It's not just the stuff you hear in 
            the movie club scenes or on the radio. It includes techno (think disco style music), House, EDM (Electronic
            Dance Music), Dubstep (Skrillex, anyone?), Trance and soooo many more! I partially grew up listening to House 
            music so I know a little more about it than the other genres. My favorite artists include: Daft Punk (amzing/10),
            Martin Garrix, deadmau5, David Guetta, Steve Aoki, ZHU, Kaskade, MISSIO, RÜFÜS DU SOL, Avicii, and way too many more. </p> <br>

    <h3> Classical </h3>
        <p> Did I suprise you? Yes, I'm aware that my music tastes are very wide spread, but that's what makes listening 
            to it fun (adding a little pizzaz to my life :D). I don't think classical music needs much introduction, asde 
            from that point I feel I need to make, which is that it's not boring. Classical music is some of the most beautiful
            you will ever hear. Different composers have different styles, so if you don't like one composer, try listening to
            another ones. And if yo don't know where to start, hopefull my recomendations can help! Some of my favorite composers 
            are: Alexandra Stréliski (a neo-classical pianist), Chopin, Rachmaninoff, Liszt, Vivaldi, Paganini and Schubert. </p> <br>
        <p id="music"> <a href=https://youtu.be/eVi3MOVPxWI=t> Berceuse, Alexandra Stréliski</a> </p> <br> <!-- piano -->
    <h3> Others?? </h3>
        <p> Other artists that I absolutely love but am not sure what genre to put them in: Hozier, Billie Eilish, khai dreams,
            Melanie Martinez and AViVA. I also occasionally listen to old 70s Hindi music. </p> <br>
          
    <h2> Why did I choose to do music of all things? </h2> <br>
        <img src="https://consordini.com/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://consordini.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/viola-and-violin.jpg&nocache=1" alt="Violins and Violas are different!"> 
                <!-- copy IMAGE ADDRESS and make sure to keep the quotation marks -->
        <h5> One difference between Violins and Violas is size. Violas are bigger than Violins, which also causes them to have a lower sound.</h5>
        <p> Music has always been somewhere in my life. I went to elementry school on Long Island, which means we had a lot more 
            funding for music and the arts. So twice a week I got to learn an instrument of my choice (my choice being the Viola). 
            I also learned the piano on the side and was in the school's chorus. So, yeah, we did a lot. Then I came to the city,
            where I still played piano (didn't go to lessons anymore though), and continued to play the viola (again, didn't learn 
            much). Time skip to high school, and now I'm in the chorus, and am learning piano again (no more viola playing though ;-;).
            My Nana and Mama (maternal grandfather and uncle in Hindi) also taught music. My mother learned how to sing at a young age
            and still sings around the house occasionally. My dad also DJed in his collage days (and still does from time to time) with 
            his best friend so that also influenced my music tastes as well (flashbacks to listening to house music in long car rides). <br>
            So yeah! Music has always been a constant in my life, and it's something I can't see myself without in the future; whether 
            it's in car rides, while studying, vibing/chilling, studying, preforming - its always gonna stick with me! </p>
