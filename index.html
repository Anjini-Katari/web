   <h2> What is music? </h2> <br>
      <p> Ahhhh music. Sometimes its the only way I can survive the upcoming week of assignments, <br> 
         tests, quizzes and zoom meetings. We hear it on the radio, the streetin nature - you <br>
        can find music anywhere you go. But what it is? </p> <br> <br>
      <p> The ever reliable dictionary defines music as "an art of sound in time that expresses <br>
        ideas and emotions in significant forms through the elements of rhythm, melody, harmony, <br>
        and color." If that mde sense to you, I applaud you. If it didn't, same here (though I <br>
        could just be tired). So if we're not using the Dictionary's definition, how should we <br>
        define music? </p> <br> <br>
      <p> In my mind, I define music as something that makes me feel something. Its the invocation of <br>
        emotions from when I hear the right chord, or harmonies, or melodies. Music is thing you can <br>
        turn to when you're not sure how you're feeling. You just feel so bad or good or meh just like a <br>
        vibe. Music can help you be in touch with that. Music is a special kind of magic that makes <br>
        everything a little better. </p> <br> <br>
