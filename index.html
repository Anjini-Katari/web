   <h2> What is music? </h2> <br>
      <p> Ahhhh music. Sometimes its the only way I can survive the upcoming week of assignments, <br> 
         tests, quizzes and zoom meetings. We hear it on the radio, the streetin nature - you <br>
        can find music anywhere you go. But what it is? </p> <br> <br>
      <p> The ever reliable dictionary defines music as "an art of sound in time that expresses <br>
        ideas and emotions in significant forms through the elements of rhythm, melody, harmony, <br>
        and color." If that mde sense to you, I applaud you. If it didn't, same here (though I <br>
        could just be tired). So if we're not using the Dictionary's definition, how should we <br>
        define music? </p> <br> <br>
      <p> In my mind, I define music as something that makes me feel something. Its the invocation of <br>
        emotions from when I hear the right chord, or harmonies, or melodies. Music is thing you can <br>
        turn to when you're not sure how you're feeling. You just feel so bad or good or meh just like a <br>
        vibe. Music can help you be in touch with that. Music is a special kind of magic that makes <br>
        everything a little better. </p> <br> <br>

   <h2> Best- I mean my favorite genres </h2> <br>
      <h3> Rock </h3>
      <p> Unpopular fact: I don't listen to The Beatles. I mean sure I've some of there songs, but honestly?
        Not really my jam. Grunge rock on the other hand is my jam! I also love alt rock, metal, punk/emo and 
        a few other subgenres I sadly don't know the names of. Some my favorite artists from this genre are:
        Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Soundgarden, grandson, Radiohead, System of a Down, Green Day, Panic! At the Disco, 
        and Matt Maeson (just to name a few...) </p> <br>
      <h3> Electronic </h3>
      <p> The electronic genre is so much bigger than we give it credit for. It's not just the stuff you hear in 
        the movie club scenes or on the radio. It includes techno (think disco style music), House, EDM (Electronic
        Dance Music), Dubstep (Skrillex, anyone?), Trance and soooo many more! I partially grew up listening to House 
        music so I know a little more about it than the other genres. My favorite artists include: Daft Punk (amzing/10),
        Martin Garrix, deadmau5, David Guetta, Steve Aoki, ZHU, Kaskade, MISSIO, RÜFÜS DU SOL, Avicii, and way too many more. </p> <br>
        <h3> Classical </h3>
        <p> Did I suprise you? Yes, I'm aware that my music tastes are very wide spread, but that's what makes listening 
          to it fun (adding a little pizzaz to my life :D). I don't think classical music needs much introduction, asde 
          from that point I feel I need to make, which is that it's not boring. Classical music is some of the most beautiful
          you will ever hear. Different composers have different styles, so if you don't like one composer, try listening to
          another ones. And if yo don't know where to start, hopefull my recomendations can help! Some of my favorite composers 
          are: Alexandra Stréliski (a neo-classical pianist), Chopin, Rachmaninoff, Liszt, Vivaldi, Paganini and Schubert. 
        <h3> Others?? </h3>
        <p> Other artists that I absolutely love but am not sure what genre to put them in: Hozier, Billie Eilish, khai dreams,
          Melanie Martinez, AViVA.
