   <h2> What is music? </h2> <br>
      <p> Ahhhh music. Sometimes its the only way I can survive the upcoming week of 
        assignments, <br> tests, quizzes and zoom meetings. We hear it on the radio, the street,
        in nature - you can find music anywhere you go. But what it is? </p> <br>
      <p> The ever reliable dictionary defines music as "an art of sound in time that expresses 
        ideas and emotions in significant forms through the elements of rhythm, melody, harmony, 
        and color." If that mde sense to you, I applaud you. If it didn't, same here (though I 
        could just be tired). So if we're not using the Dictionary's definition, how should we 
        define music? </p> <br>
